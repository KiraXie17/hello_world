The interactive installation that I am interested in is called “Seeing and Believing”, done by Leandro Erlich. Leandro Erlich is an Argentinian contemporary artist that are widely acknowledged for his innovative use of optical illusions, 3-D effects, and computer generated sound effects. I actually went to see his exhibition in December last year in Mori Museum, Tokyo. His artworks use mirrors, special sounds and 3-D perspective objects to create “illusion” that challenges our common sense, and remind us that what we see as “reality” does not necessarily stand for the reality. 
### Art Piece 1
Port of Reflections
One artwork that I like is called “Port of Reflections.” It uses metal frame to create the body shape of boats and uses mirrors to create the reflections. The movement of the boats and the sounds of water are generated by computer program. With the movement of boat, sounds coming from the background, the artwork creates a sense of illusion of reality.

### Art Piece 2

the Neighbors
The Second artwork that I like is called the Neighbors. Like many other works of Leandro Erlich, this work is derived from the every day life of ordinary people but it also challenges our understanding of common sense. The Neighbors is basically a door and a phone. You can hear the sounds that “neighbors” makes through the phone, and feel the footsteps. And again, the sounds are all generated by codes in computer. The reason that I like about the artworks created by Leandro Erlich is that he challenges my perception of ordinary life and creates something interested from it. It reminds me that every mundane place can turn into a world of fantasies, surprises, paradoxes and illusions.
